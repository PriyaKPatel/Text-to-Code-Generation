        "Given the goal of improving software development productivity with machine learning methods, software intelligence research has attracted increasing attention in both academia and industries over the last decade. Software code intelligence techniques can help developers reduce tedious repetitive workloads, enhance the programming quality, and improve the overall software development productivity. This would reduce time spent writing software as well as reduce computational and operational costs.\n",

        "[Text-to-code generation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/text-to-code-generation) is a task where we can generate code based on the natural language description. It can further be used to build an AI-powered coding assistant. Developers simply type the natural language description or the function signature to specify their intents, and the AI coding assistant can generate or complete the target function for them. This helps to accelerate implementation and also reduce their reliance on external resources.\n",

The target sequence is shifted to the right, i.e., prepended by a start-sequence token and fed to the decoder using the `decoder_input_ids`. In teacher-forcing style, the target sequence is then appended by the EOS token and corresponds to the `labels`. The PAD token is hereby used as the start-sequence token.

        "    - The `Dataset.from_generator` constructor converts the python generator to a fully functional `tf.data.Dataset`. The constructor takes a callable as input, not an iterator. This allows it to restart the generator when it reaches the end. The `output_types` argument is required because `tf.data` builds a `tf.Graph` internally, and graph edges require a `tf.dtype`. It's also important to note that the `output_shapes` and `output_types` follow the same nesting rules as other dataset methods.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - The simplest way to iterate over a dataset in multiple epochs is to use the `Dataset.repeat()` transformation. Applying the `Dataset.repeat()` transformation with no arguments will repeat the input indefinitely.\n",
        "    - The `Dataset.shuffle()` transformation maintains a fixed-size buffer and chooses the next element uniformly at random from that buffer. We apply `Dataset.shuffle()` only for training dataset and not for validation dataset.\n",
        "    - A `Dataset.batch` applied after `Dataset.repeat` will yield batches that straddle epoch boundaries. If you need clear epoch separation, put `Dataset.batch` before the repeat.\n",
        "    - Prefetching overlaps the preprocessing and model execution of a training step. While the model is executing training step `s`, the input pipeline is reading the data for step `s+1`. Doing so reduces the step time to the maximum (as opposed to the sum) of the training and the time it takes to extract the data. The `tf.data` API provides the `tf.data.Dataset.prefetch` transformation. It can be used to decouple the time when data is produced from the time when data is consumed. The number of elements to prefetch should be equal to (or possibly greater than) the number of batches consumed by a single training step. You could either manually tune this value, or set it to `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`, which will prompt the `tf.data` runtime to tune the value dynamically at runtime."

This way, the size of the set of words (a.k.a the number of words in the set) can dynamically increase and decrease according to the next word's probability distribution. Here we can use Top-p sampling by setting 0 < `top_p` < 1.\n",
